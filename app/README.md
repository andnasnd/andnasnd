# zzhack

By tailoring the [zzhack GitHub repo]("https://github.com/zzhack-stack/zzhack") to fit my needs, I didn't have to re-invent the wheel. It's cool that the site is built upon Rust & Yew.

## Motivation

The motivation for this website is to have something internet-facing, in case it comes up in an interview or something.

## UI Design

I just sort of hacked together my rendition based upon the original [zzhack repository]("https://github.com/zzhack-stack/zzhack")

If you have some advice for design, please contact me via [email](Mailto:anambakam@icloud.com) with any inquiries!
